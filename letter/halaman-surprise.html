        <h2>Letter</h2>
        <p class="greeting">Dear,<br>
            Tiara Salsabila</p>
        <p class="message">I hope this letter finds you well. It's been a while since we last caught up, and I've been reminiscing about the good times we shared in Bali. Time has flown by, but the memories are still vivid in my mind. I can't believe it's been <span id="timer"></span> since we've known each other.</p>
        <p class="message">I wanted to reach out and see how you've been. Life on my end has been quite a ride since leaving Bali. I'm all about chasing dreams, you know? Working from home is more than just a gig for me, it's a whole vibe that lets me explore and do my thing. Being a recruiter is cool, diving into people's potential beyond the usual resume stuff, thanks to my psych background.</p>
        <p class="message">Bandung and surrounding areas is where the action is! The city's got this awesome vibe that syncs perfectly with my energy. And let's talk about this goal of mine, to be a digital nomad. Picture this: working on web development projects while hopping around the globe. It's like a dream in the making.</p>
        <p class="message">Back at home, my cat is my partner in crime, bringing some cozy vibes to the scene. And, of course, I've got this movie-watching habit that's become a staple in my downtime.</p>
        <p class="message">Life's a canvas, and I'm splashing it with the colors of work from home, travel dreams, and the ongoing adventure of learning web development. Every day's a new chapter, and I'm loving the unpredictability of it all!</p>
        <p class="message">However, I often find myself thinking about the events you organized and the genuine camaraderie we had. Those were truly special moments, It's crazy how those moments become touchstones in lives, little pockets of time that I find myself revisiting.</p>
        <p class="message">As I think back, it's not just the events themselves but the energy you put into them that made them unforgettable. but it's the heart and soul you poured, creating nice atmosphere, authentic connections. Those moments were like snapshots of pure joy, frozen in time. Although sometimes it's drained your energy... But, hey you always use that energy to bring positivity, it's a superpower that people rarely have, hopefully you realize that.</p>
        <p class="message">I wonder, did you change much? Or you are still the same Ara who's energetic, passionate, funny, has a good sense of humour, smart, invulnerable and immortal... in my brain~<br>
            I always be proud of you! Even at the first glance during break time when I asked you to join me and my friends for lunch. Your energy and kindness made a lasting impression on me.</p>
        <p class="message">I've never met someone like you till today... I mean, you can make me, a person who has a hard time starting a conversation, talk to you first.</p>
        <p class="message">I've been having major nostalgia moments, thinking about our chats and laughter that echoed through the chaos of Bali's traffic, and if you remember… our melting ice cream. Those were the days, right? I can practically hear the scooter engines and you nagging me to slow down when I try to conquer the streets.</p>
        <p class="message">Oh…  I also miss your big smile! Seriously, it's like a beacon of happiness. Do you have any idea how many gloomy days that smile chased away? I've come to realize it's also a superpower. It's so infectious, I half expected it to pop out of my screen just reading this.</p>
        <p class="message">And just for the record, I also miss the feeling of fear that your smile used to bring. You know, that genuine fear that your teeth would get dry from grinning too much. It's the kind of worry we all need more of in our lives.</p>
        <p class="message">Not to mention, I miss the sparkle in your eyes and the unique charm of your butterfly-shaped-like glasses. Your whole aura is a delightful combination, making every interaction so enjoyable. It's the little details like your eyes and glasses that add a touch of your personality.</p>
        <p class="message">I know life can get busy, and it's easy to lose touch. However, if we were to compare my brain to a computer and you to an application, consider yourself always running in the background that sometimes just pops up.</p>
        <p class="message">By the way… Happy Birthday!! Another year older, but who's counting anyway? May your day be filled with more joy! Remember, you're not getting older, you're just upgrading to a newer version of awesomeness.</p>
        <p class="message">Now, let's talk about birthday resolutions. My suggestion is… No matter how, no matter what you do, you have to love yourself more, how about resolving to laugh louder, dance like nobody's watching, and eat cake with zero guilt? Trust me, it's the secret to eternal happiness.</p>
        <p class="message">And let's not forget your smile. I hope those smiles never fade because… It's not just a smile, for me it's a mood booster, a stress reliever, and a certified happiness generator. Seriously, they should bottle up your laughter and sell it as the best medicine. </p>
        <p class="message">So, here's to another year of adventures, laughter, and discovering the awesomeness that awaits you. May your birthday be the beginning of a new chapter filled with exciting plot twists and heartwarming moments.</p>
        <p class="message">Btw, you don't have to say anything back, I just wanted you to know I was thinking about you in your birthday and... sometimes.</p>
        <p class="closing">Take Care,<br>
