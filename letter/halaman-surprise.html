        <h2>Letter</h2>
        <p class="greeting">Dear,<br>
            Tiara Salsabila</p>
        <p class="message">I hope this letter finds you well. It's been a while since we last caught up, and I've been reminiscing about the good times we shared in Bali. Time has flown by, but the memories are still vivid in my mind.</p>
        <p class="message">I wanted to reach out and see how you've been. Life on my end has been quite a ride since leaving Bali. Pursuing my dream, working and learning to diving into the world of web development… I often find myself thinking about the events you organized and the genuine camaraderie we had. Those were truly special moments.</p>
        <p class="message">I wonder, did you change much? Or you are still the same Ara who's energetic, passionate, funny, has a good sense of humour, smart, invulnerable and immortal... in my brain~<br>
            I always be proud of you! Even at the first glance during break time when I asked you to join me and my friends for lunch. Your energy and kindness made a lasting impression on me.</p>
        <p class="message">I've never met someone like you till today... I mean, you can make me, a person who has a hard time starting a conversation, talk to you first.</p>
        <p class="message">I've been having major nostalgia moments, thinking about our chats and laughter that echoed through the chaos of Bali's traffic, and if you remember… our melting ice cream. Those were the days, right? I can practically hear the scooter engines and you nagging me to slow down when I try to conquer the streets.</p>
        <p class="message">Oh…  I also miss your big smile! Seriously, it's like a beacon of happiness. Do you have any idea how many gloomy days that smile chased away? I've come to realize it's a superpower. It's so infectious, I half expected it to pop out of my screen just reading this. </p>
        <p class="message">And just for the record, I also miss the feeling of fear that your smile used to bring. You know, that genuine fear that your teeth would get dry from grinning too much. It's the kind of worry we all need more of in our lives.</p>
        <p class="message">I know life can get busy, and it's easy to lose touch. However, if we were to compare my brain to a computer and you to an application, consider yourself always running in the background that sometimes just pops up.</p>
        <p class="message">Ohiya… Happy Birthday!! Another year older, but who's counting anyway? May your day be filled with more joy! Remember, you're not getting older, you're just upgrading to a newer version of awesomeness.</p>
        <p class="message">Now, let's talk about birthday resolutions. Forget the gym, how about resolving to laugh louder, dance like nobody's watching, and eat cake with zero guilt? Trust me, it's the secret to eternal happiness.</p>
        <p class="message">And let's not forget your smile. I hope those smiles never fade because… It's not just a smile; it's a mood booster, a stress reliever, and a certified happiness generator. Seriously, they should bottle up your laughter and sell it as the best medicine. </p>
        <p class="message">So, here's to another year of adventures, laughter, and discovering the awesomeness that awaits you. May your birthday be the beginning of a new chapter filled with exciting plot twists and heartwarming moments.</p>
        <p class="message">Okay I think that's enough, I think if the letter is too long it will be weird... right?</p>
        <p class="message">Btw, you don't have to say anything back, I just wanted you to know I was thinking about you in your birthday and... sometimes.</p>
        <p class="closing">Take Care,<br>
            Vega Arrafah</p>
