        <h2>Letter</h2>
        <p class="greeting">Dear,</p>
        <p class="greeting">Tiara Salsabila</p>
        <p class="message">I hope this letter finds you well. It's been a while since we last caught up, and I've been reminiscing about the good times we shared in Bali. Time has flown by, but the memories are still vivid in my mind.</p>
        <p class="message">I wanted to reach out and see how you've been. Life on my end has been quite a ride since leaving Bali. Pursuing my dream, working and learning to diving into the world of web developmentâ€¦ I often find myself thinking about the events you organized and the genuine camaraderie we had. Those were truly special moments.</p>
        <p class="message">I wonder, did you change much? Or you are still the same Ara who's energetic, passionate, funny, has a good sense of humour, smart, invulnerable and immortal... in my brain~
            I always be proud of you! Even at the first glance during break time when I asked you to join me and my friends for lunch. Your energy and kindness made a lasting impression on me.
            </p>
        <p class="closing">Salam hangat,</p>
